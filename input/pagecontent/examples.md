### Introduction
The following use cases are exemplified with FHIR instances in this guide. Every effort has been made to be accurate, but these are intended as examples and may not include referenced data such as an Encounter. They are from real world examples and show how the AdveseEvent Clinical Research Profile is intended to be generally used.

Clinical Trial – Significant Adverse Event

This scenario involves a phase 2, clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a new oral agent administered daily for treatment of severe psoriasis unresponsive to FDA-approved treatments.  There are two arms of the study – subjects receiving the new oral agent or a placebo.  Only the research pharmacist is aware of the arm assignment.    The fifth subject enrolled in the trial develops severe hepatic failure complicated by encephalopathy one month after starting the study. 

The known risk profile of the new oral agent prior to this event included mild elevation of serum liver enzymes in 10% of subjects receiving the agent during previous clinical studies, but there was no other history of subjects developing clinically significant liver disease.  The IRB approved protocol and informed consent document for the study identifies mild liver injury as a risk of the research.

The study sponsors determined that is an unanticipated problem that must be reported because although the risk of mild liver injury was foreseen, severe liver injury resulting in hepatic failure was unexpected in severity; possibly related to participation in the research; and serious.
